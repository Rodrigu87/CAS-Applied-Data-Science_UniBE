This repo is a collection of documents, projects, and hands-on experiments showcasing my learning journey in data science

# About the CAS Applied Data Science
The CAS in Applied Data Science is a professional certificate program at the University of Bern equipping participants with practical skills and tools for real-world data analysis and machine-learning applications.

# About my journey in CAS Applied Data science
I enrolled in the CAS in Applied Data Science (University of Bern) in 2025 as a natural step in strengthening my ability to bridge science, policy, and practice for sustainable development. Prior to this, I completed a Professional Certificate in Public Policy Analysis at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
This CAS reflects my commitment to deepening my technical expertise—advancing my proficiency in Python, refreshing and expanding my statistical skills, improving my data analysis capabilities, and gaining hands-on experience in machine learning. Through this journey, I aim to develop the capacity to uncover insights hidden in data and apply them to inform evidence-informed policies and real-world interventions.

# How to navigate this repo
This repo is structured into six modules, with each module including both the learning materials and its corresponding project. It also contains my final project for the CAS
