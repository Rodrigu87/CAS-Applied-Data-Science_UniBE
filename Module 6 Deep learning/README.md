#About Module 6 Ethics and best practices
This module introduces the foundations of deep learning, covering neural networks, optimization techniques, and key architectures used in modern AI. Morning sessions focus on essential concepts and hands-on implementation in Python, while afternoons offer time to recharge—whether by skiing, working, or engaging in personal activities. The module blends rigorous learning with mindful practice, helping participants develop both technical skills and the reflective mindset needed to design and train effective deep learning models.
