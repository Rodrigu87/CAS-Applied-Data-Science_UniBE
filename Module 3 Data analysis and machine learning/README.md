# About Module 3 Data analysis and machine learning
This module introduces core techniques of data analysis and machine learning. It covers supervised and unsupervised learning methods, model training, evaluation, and selection, with a strong emphasis on practical implementation in Python. Through hands-on exercises, learners develop the ability to build predictive models, uncover patterns in data, and apply machine learning approaches to solve real-world problems.

## Learning objectives
- Understand key concepts in supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Preprocess and structure data for modelling, including feature engineering and scaling.
- Train, evaluate, and compare machine learning models using appropriate metrics.
- Apply clustering, classification, and regression techniques to real-world datasets.
- Implement end-to-end machine learning workflows in Python, from data preparation to model validation.
